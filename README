Pinball Project is a pinball game which was developed using Java, OOP Design Principles and the UDP networking protocol.
The developed product enabled users to create their own table layouts, with individualised component interaction logic, and play them with their friends over UDP networking.

The project won the Verint-Sponsored 3rd year project prize.
