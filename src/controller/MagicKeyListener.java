/**
 * A MagicKeyListener is decorator for a KeyListener.
 *
 * <p>This class adds three pieces of functionality.  First, it delays
 * key events (moving them to the back of the event queue).  Second,
 * it maintains state so that when a press-and-release event pair is
 * sitting in the queue, neither event is propogated to the adaptee
 * (decoratee).  Finally, it can (optionally) add to the semantics so
 * that any release event implies that any still-pressed keys have
 * also been released.
 *
 * <p>Together, these additions may provide more meaningful semantics
 * of key listening in an environment where a key being held down
 * generates repeated key events, or where multiple keys pressed
 * generate a release event for only one of them.
